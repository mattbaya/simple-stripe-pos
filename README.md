# stripe-s700-simple-pos
A simple customizable Point-of-Sale (POS) system that works with the Stripe Reader S700 mobile credit card reader. Installed inside a docker container so it can be spun up on-demand at places like DigitalOcean without having to pay monthly costs. Set up to relay email out via your Google workspace or gmail account (or other SMTP servers).
