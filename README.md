3. **Docker & Docker Compose**: Installed on server ✅
4. **Domain**: reader.southwilliamstown.org configured ✅

## Stripe Setup

### 1. Get API Keys

1. Log in to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Go to Developers → API keys
3. Copy your **Publishable key** and **Secret key**
4. Make sure you're using the correct keys for your environment (test vs live)

### 2. Create a Location

1. In the Stripe Dashboard, go to Terminal → Locations
2. Click "Create location"
3. Enter your address and business details
4. Copy the **Location ID** (starts with `tml_`)

### 3. Register Your S700 Terminal

1. Power on your Stripe S700 terminal
2. In the Stripe Dashboard, go to Terminal → Readers
3. Click "Register reader"
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect your S700 to WiFi
5. The terminal will display a registration code
6. Enter the code in the Stripe Dashboard
7. Assign the reader to the location you created
8. Give the reader a memorable label (e.g., "Donation Table Reader")

### 4. Test the Terminal

1. Use Stripe's test mode first to ensure everything works
2. Test with Stripe's test cards (available in their documentation)
3. Switch to live mode only when ready for actual payments

### 5. Email Setup with OAuth2 (Optional)

The system can automatically send receipt emails to donors and notification emails to your organization using Google OAuth2 authentication.

#### Step 1: Google Cloud Console Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing project
3. Enable the **Gmail API**:
   - Go to APIs & Services → Library
   - Search for "Gmail API" and enable it
4. Create OAuth2 credentials:
   - Go to APIs & Services → Credentials
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Application type: "Desktop application"
   - Name: "SWCA POS System"
   - Add `http://localhost` to authorized redirect URIs
   - Save the Client ID and Client Secret

#### Step 2: Generate Refresh Token
Since you have your Client ID and Secret, you need to generate a refresh token:

1. **Install dependencies** (on your local machine):
   ```bash
   pip install google-auth-oauthlib
   ```

2. **Run the token generator script**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/swca/pos-docker
   python3 generate_oauth_token.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Enter your Client ID and Secret
   - Browser will open for Google authorization
   - Sign in and grant Gmail send permissions
   - Script will display your refresh token

#### Step 3: Configure Environment
Add the OAuth2 values to your `.env` file:
```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
FROM_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com
```

**Email Configuration Notes:**
- OAuth2 is configured and working ✅
- Gmail API credentials are properly set up
- Transaction notifications are sent to info@southwilliamstown.org
- Receipts are sent to donors who provide email addresses
- OAuth2 refresh tokens don't expire unless revoked

## Installation & Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal Not Found

**Current Setup:**
- Reader: SWCA S700 Reader (tmr_GJIc8gfqlW1SF1)
- Status: Online ✅
- Location: tml_GJFbNglXXR3JXh ✅

**If issues occur:**
- Ensure S700 is powered on and connected to WiFi
- Refresh the page to reload reader status automatically
- Check Stripe Dashboard → Terminal → Readers for status
- Use `/admin-readers` page for manual reader management

### Payment Failures

- Check Stripe Dashboard → Payments for error details
- Ensure API keys are correct and for the right environment (test/live)
- Verify terminal has good internet connectivity
- Check application logs: `docker compose logs -f`

### Application Won't Start

- Check environment variables in `.env` file
- Verify Docker and Docker Compose are installed
- Check port 8080 isn't already in use: `ss -tlnp | grep 8080`
- Review logs for specific error messages

### Connection Issues

- Ensure firewall allows traffic on port 8080
- For external access, you may need to configure your router/firewall
- Check if other services are using the same port

### Email Issues

**Emails Not Sending:**
- Check application logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- Verify SMTP credentials in `.env` file
- Ensure email account has app password generated (for Gmail)
- Test SMTP settings with a simple email client first

**OAuth2-Specific Issues:**
- Make sure Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Verify redirect URI `http://localhost` is added to OAuth2 credentials
- Check that refresh token was generated correctly
- Refresh tokens don't expire but can be revoked by user

**Receipt Email Issues:**
- Email address is now required for all transactions
- Using Gmail API instead of SMTP for reliable delivery ✅
- Check that `FROM_EMAIL` is configured in `.env`
- Review logs for Gmail API error messages

**Notification Email Issues:**
- Configure `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` in `.env` for your organization
- Ensure the SMTP account has permission to send to this address
- Ensure the SMTP account has permission to send to external addresses

## Security Considerations

- Stripe live API keys are properly configured ✅
- Production environment with live payments ✅
- HTTPS enabled with automatic SSL certificates via Caddy ✅
- Security headers and domain enforcement ✅
- OAuth2 authentication for email services ✅
- Environment files (.env) are gitignored ✅
- Regular dependency updates recommended

## Customization

### Changing Default Amounts

Edit membership amounts in `.env` file (amounts in cents):
```env
INDIVIDUAL_MEMBERSHIP_AMOUNT=4000  # $40.00
HOUSEHOLD_MEMBERSHIP_AMOUNT=6000   # $60.00
```

### Fee Coverage Feature

The application automatically calculates Stripe processing fees (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction) and allows users to optionally cover these fees. When enabled:

- Users see a transparent breakdown: base amount, fee amount, and total
- Fee calculation updates dynamically as donation amounts change
- All payment metadata includes fee information for reporting
- Receipts clearly indicate when fees were covered

Examples:
- $20 donation + fees = $20.88 total (covers $0.88 in processing fees)
- $35 individual membership + fees = $36.32 total (covers $1.32 in processing fees)
- $50 household membership + fees = $51.75 total (covers $1.75 in processing fees)

### Modifying the Interface

- Edit `templates/index.html` to change the UI
- Add custom CSS in the `<style>` section
- Modify button text, colors, or layout as needed

### Adding Features

The Flask application (`app/main.py`) can be extended with:
- Email receipts
- Payment reporting
- Custom donation amounts/tiers
- Member information collection
- Integration with other systems

### Environment-Specific Settings

For different environments (development/production):

```env
# Development
FLASK_ENV=development
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Production  
FLASK_ENV=production
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
```
